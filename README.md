### Library Detector (Academic Tool)



#### What is this?

Library Detector (Academic Tool), **LD(AT)**, is a Chrome extension which can detect all JavaScript libraries runs behind the web and examine their versions. LD(AT) collects 546 most popular libraries information from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/). The complete library list can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronxyliu/PTV/blob/main/LIBLIST.md) The library detection ability has academic research support. More information please refer to the ASE 2023 paper [PTdetector: An Automated JavaScript Front-end Library Detector](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373638073_PTDETECTOR_An_Automated_JavaScript_Front-end_Library_Detector).

#### How does it work?

LD(AT) applies pTree-based detection during the browser runtime. We collect pTree information for each library in advance and extract their valuable detection feature. The feature generation process is compeleted in the repository [PTV-gen](https://github.com/aaronxyliu/Anonymous).

#### How to use?

You can download this tool in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/library-detector-academic/liedgiagjapaehficeimmjcemnknmdfp). Please give a kind rating if you think it is good to use!

For developers: open the Chrome browser, navigate to the `chrome://extensions/` site, , click the "Load Unpacked" button to load this whole folder. Then, pin it in the browser extensions menu.

In the popup, click the "detect" button. The detectioned libraries and corresponding versions will show. Sometimes, one library may relate to mutiple versions. In most cases (in fact, only except core-js), it means the correct version is one of them â€“ the detector can not tell the minor difference between these versions.
